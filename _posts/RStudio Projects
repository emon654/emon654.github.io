## Description


### Introduction
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. RStudio is available in open source and commercial editions and runs on the desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux) or in a browser connected to RStudio Server or RStudio Server Pro (Debian/Ubuntu, Red Hat/CentOS, and SUSE Linux).

### Text Table

The text table shows the top 5 universities in each country. The rankings consist of world rank, quality of faculty, and publication. Publication shows how well a student can be supplied with schooling needs. An example would be textbooks or online resources provided by the instructor. Another example would be as a student I was provided a limited time access to be Tableau for academic purposes. As shown these are details from 2015s data and viewing the data I was somewhat shocked by the results. I always thought other countries had a higher world ranking, but it would seem USA has a higher ranking which also includes faculty and publication. 


### Average score of all colleges in each area

Recently, I showed the top 5 universities but I decided to show the relevant countries average score. I used a calculated field to show an average score of each year from all universities in each vicinity. I also included years from 2012 to 2015, and I added a parameter called proficiency to display what surpassed the certain score. I gave it 3 filters which are country, year, and alumni employment. It will give the user a chance to have different views of countries, years, and how the alumni employment can effect the numbers.  

### National Rankings

As many of us are students in the United States I have taken the top 10 universities and compared them. As you would hover over the bars the tooltip provides information based on itâ€™s national rank, education, faculty, and score. It would seem Harvard is the highest quality of all, and California Institute of of Technology ranked last. Overall, these are elite colleges with strong teachers educating their students to be well versed in the subject matter. 

## Overall

### Impediments

I may had many columns and rows in my dataset, but I wish I could have shown the data with different graphs. The data that I had were more discrete since most of it was rankings. The data field score was continuous, however; it relates to its overall quality of the university. As per for my research question I was not able to do much with calculated fields since I primarily wanted to show the comparisons of different colleges. I have used it for developing diagram purposes such averaging out the score, placeholders, Strings, and for parameters. These helped me create the charts I needed to show what is important.   

### Practices From the Author
As per for strategies I incorporated from the book I concentrated on avoiding clutter. I utlized a few color variations such as 'blue' and'grey' to differentiate the many bars shown. My visualzation are quite simple when it comes to displaying them. Mainly, I used performance bar charts just to show who or what is doing better. 


* Each chart represents some form of competitiveness when looking at the data. These charts can provide an outlook for those who would like to know the overall quality of schools in different areas. Although, the idea of school is recieving education it would be interesting to know what places offers the best education. There are many that would like to study abroad for the experiance, however; the value of the institution is also important. 


### Conclusion

In conclusion, USA seemed to have higher quality education in comparison to the other countries. Although, in past years in 2012 and 2013 the United Kingdom had surpassed the United States slightly. Based on the average scores the United Kingdom supplemented better education in those two years. Now, looking at 2015s data the results had declined for all of them but USA has the highest percentage. I will be honest I randomly selected these four countries to compare, but looking at their rankings for the top 5 colleges it seems as though there is much quality in all of them. I am quite shocked that USA provides the highest quality of education. My best guess is they have state of the art equipment and processes to provide adequate education.

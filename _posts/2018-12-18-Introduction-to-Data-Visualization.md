## Description


### Introduction

<h2> Tableau is a tool which allows the user to create interactive visualization concentrating on business intelligence. Tableau offers insight based on data which gives a clear visual on progress, information, reports, and much more. Tableau is easy to use to those who are non-technical so it has complete usability to those who are not familiar. The data can be easily formatted in different charts which gives users the pleasure to create a plethora of charts all in one tool. What makes Tableau great is it can support many resolution as you can make ajustments to display your visuals such as desktops and mobile devices. Tableau has an active community to solve any issues with your predicaments or people would make suggestions. It is able to connect to a wide range of data sources such as excel files, text files, and even databases sources. In comparison to Microsoft excel there is not many features and as many charts for users, but with Tableau the user can provide more detail in their diagrams. As mentioned before Tableau is easy to use for technical and non-technical users. </h2>

### DataSet

I decided on selecting a data source with much to work with. Luckily, I was able to retrieve a dataset pertaining to college rankings worldwide. It was also recent rankings from the years 2012 to 2015. As I reviewed the data set it had many rows to explore, so this gave me the oppurtunity to priortize countires with colleges that had a higher rank. There is much data fields such as institution, world rank, national rank, quality of education,  that helped me make comparsions of colleges. The data that was represented were many rankings, so there were not consider continous. If I were using them as continous it would add them up as 'sum' but that would misleading since that was not the purpose. 

* World Rank showed ranks for each college and I applied the Year data field since data changes every year.
* Publications gives me an idea of how well a school prepares their students for success, or if the supplies are easily accessible. 
* National rank displayed the rank within the country. 
* Score was one I have used a lot since it showed its overall quality of the university. 
* Quality of Education and Faculty was a rank that represented how well is their teachings to students.  

## Visuals

### Text Table

The text table shows the top 5 universities in each country. The rankings consist of world rank, quality of faculty, and publication. Publication shows how well a student can be supplied with schooling needs. An example would be textbooks or online resources provided by the instructor. Another example would be as a student I was provided a limited time access to be Tableau for academic purposes. As shown these are details from 2015s data and viewing the data I was somewhat shocked by the results. I always thought other countries had a higher world ranking, but it would seem USA has a higher ranking which also includes faculty and publication. 


### Average score of all colleges in each area

Recently, I showed the top 5 universities but I decided to show the relevant countries average score. I used a calculated field to show an average score of each year from all universities in each vicinity. I also included years from 2012 to 2015, and I added a parameter called proficiency to display what surpassed the certain score. I gave it 3 filters which are country, year, and alumni employment. It will give the user a chance to have different views of countries, years, and how the alumni employment can effect the numbers.  

### National Rankings

As many of us are students in the United States I have taken the top 10 universities and compared them. As you would hover over the bars the tooltip provides information based on itâ€™s national rank, education, faculty, and score. It would seem Harvard is the highest quality of all, and California Institute of of Technology ranked last. Overall, these are elite colleges with strong teachers educating their students to be well versed in the subject matter. 

## Overall

### Impediments

I may had many columns and rows in my dataset, but I wish I could have shown the data with different graphs. The data that I had were more discrete since most of it was rankings. The data field score was continuous, however; it relates to its overall quality of the university. As per for my research question I was not able to do much with calculated fields since I primarily wanted to show the comparisons of different colleges. I have used it for developing diagram purposes such averaging out the score, placeholders, Strings, and for parameters. These helped me created the charts I needed to show what is important.   

### Practices From the Author
As per for strategies I provided from the book I concentrated on avoiding clutter. I utlized a few color variations such as 'blue' and'grey' to differentiate the many bars shown. My visualzation are quite simple when it comes to displaying them. Mainly, I used performance bar charts just to show who or what is doing better. 


* Each chart represents some form of competitiveness when looking at the data. These charts can provide an outlook for those who would like to know the overall quality of schools in different areas. Although, the idea of school is recieving education it would be interesting to know what places offers the best education. There are many that would like ot study abroad for the experiance, however; the value of the institution is also important. 


### Conclusion

In conclusion, USA seemed to have higher quality education in comparison to the other countries. Although, in past years in 2012 and 2013 the United Kingdom had surpassed the United States slightly. Based on the average scores the United Kingdom supplemented better education in those two years. Now, looking at 2015s data the results had declined for all of them but USA has the highest percentage. I will be honest I randomly selected these four countries to compare, but looking at their rankings for the top 5 colleges it seems as though there is much quality. I am quite shocked that USA provides the highest quality of education. My best guess is they have state of the art equipment and processes to provide adequate education.

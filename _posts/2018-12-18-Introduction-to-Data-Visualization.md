### Introduction

Tableau offers insight based on data which gives a clear visual on progress, information, reports, and much more.

It is able to connect to a wide range of data sources such as excel files, text files, and even databases sources. In comparison to Microsoft excel there is not many features and as charts are made you can provide more detail in Tableau. As mentioned before Tableau is easy to use for technical and non-technical users.

### Data Source

I decided on selecting a data source with much to work with. Luckily, I was able to retrieve a dataset pertaining to college rankings worldwide. It was also recent rankings from the years 2012 to 2015. As I reviewed the data set it had many rows to explore, so this gave me the oppurtunity to priortize countires with colleges that had a higher rank. There is much data fields such as institution, world rank, national rank, quality of education and others that helped me make comparsions of colleges.

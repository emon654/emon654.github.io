## Description


### Introduction

Tableau is a tool which allows the user to create interactive visualization concentrating on business intelligence. Tableau offers insight based on data which gives a clear visual on progress, information, reports, and much more. Tableau is easy to use to those who are non-technical so it has complete usability to those who are not familiar. The data can be easily formatted in different charts which gives users the pleasure to create a plethora of charts all in one tool. What makes Tableau great is it can support many resolution as you can make ajustments to display your visuals such as desktops and mobile devices. Tableau has an active community to solve any issues with your predicaments or people would make suggestions. It is able to connect to a wide range of data sources such as excel files, text files, and even databases sources. In comparison to Microsoft excel there is not many features and as charts are made you can provide more detail in Tableau. As mentioned before Tableau is easy to use for technical and non-technical users.

### DataSet

I decided on selecting a data source with much to work with. Luckily, I was able to retrieve a dataset pertaining to college rankings worldwide. It was also recent rankings from the years 2012 to 2015. As I reviewed the data set it had many rows to explore, so this gave me the oppurtunity to priortize countires with colleges that had a higher rank. There is much data fields such as institution, world rank, national rank, quality of education,  that helped me make comparsions of colleges. 


## Visuals

### Text Table

The text table shows the top 5 universities in each country. The rankings consist of world rank, quality of faculty, and publication. Publication shows how well a student can be supplied with schooling needs. An example would be textbooks or online resources provided by the instructor. As a student I was provided a limited time access to be Tableau for academic purposes. As shown these are details from 2015s data and viewing the data I was somewhat shocked by the results. I always thought other countries had a higher world ranking, but it would seem USA has a higher ranking which also includes faculty and publication. 


### Average score of all colleges in each area

Recently, I showed the top 5 universities but I decided to show the relevant countries average score. I used a calculated field to show an average score of each year from all universities in each vicinity. I also included years from 2012 to 2015, and I added a parameter called proficiency to display what surpassed the certain score. I gave it 3 filters which are country, year, and alumni employment. It will give the user a chance to have different views of countries, years, and how the alumni employment can effect the numbers.  

### National Rankings

As many of us are students in the United States I have taken the top 10 universities and compared them. As you would hover over the bars the tooltip provides information based on itâ€™s national rank, education, faculty, and score. It would seem Harvard is the highest quality of all, and California Institute of of Technology ranked last. Overall, these are elite colleges with strong teachers educating their students to be well versed in the subject matter.
